## NuGet Package

This project is now available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OnionArch.Mvc)

## Running The Application

1. Ensure that the `appsettings.json` file contains a valid `ConnectionStrings` section.

You will need two connection strings:

* onionDataConnection

This is the database which will contain all of the Book and Series information

* onionAuthConnection

This is the database which will contain all of the ASP.NET MVC Core auth information.

Example ConnectionStrings section:

    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "onionDataConnection": "DataSource=onionData.db",
      "onionAuthConnection": "DataSource=onionAuth.db"
    },

2. Open a command prompt in the `Onion.Web` directory

Issue the following commands to set up the databases:

    dotnet restore

Check for migrations in the `Onion.Repo.Identity` directory. If there isn't a directory labelled `Migrations`, then run the following (from the `Onion.Web`) directory to generate them:

    dotnet ef migrations add CreateIdentitySchema -c AppIdentityDbContext -p ../Onion.Repo/Onion.Repo.csproj -s Onion.Web.csproj

Similarly, check for migrations in the `Onion.Repo.Data` directory. If there isn't a directory labelled `Migrations`, then run the following (from the `Onion.Web`) directory to generate them:

    dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration -c DataContext -p ../Onion.Repo/Onion.Repo.csproj -s Onion.Web.csproj

Apply all migrations to the databases by running the following commands (from the `Onion.Web` directory):

    dotnet ef database update -c DataContext -p ../Onion.Repo/Onion.Repo.csproj -s Onion.Web.csproj
    dotnet ef database update -c AppIdentityDbContext -p ../Onion.Repo/Onion.Repo.csproj -s Onion.Web.csproj

3. Build the front end

Issue the following commands from the `Onion.Web` directory:

    npm i
    npm run build

4. Run the application and seed the database

Issue the following command from the `Onion.Web` directory:

    dotnet run
